The MobilePlayground iOS application is a demonstration app that makes it
possible to generate Google Analytics events from an iOS device. To build the
application, you will need to copy libGoogleAnalytics.a and GANTracker.h to this
directory, or update the paths of those files in Xcode to point to where you
have installed those files.

This app is distributed in source form. See COPYING for license information.
